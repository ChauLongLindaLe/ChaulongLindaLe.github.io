        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Graduating from my Bachelors, I decided to take on the working world and after two years I felt that I wasn’t able to flex my creative muscles in the way I had envisioned for myself. With this in mind I decided to start experimenting with JavaScript, HTML and CSS and I realised that it was something that incorporated the spheres of logic and creativity.  On this realisation I decided to take the leap from being an English and Creative Writing graduate to a Junior Web Developer. It has been incredibly gratifying to see my ideas come to life with the use of what I have learnt as a result of my web development course and I cannot wait to keep creating and designing in my next company.

      <h2>BA (Hons)English Language and Creative Writing 2:1 - University of Gloucestershire ‘12-’15</h2>

      <h1>“Jack of all trades, master of none”</h1>

      <p>Often a phrase that we associate that in the process of trying to learn many things, you give up the mastery of any of them. I believe this to be a myth.</p>

      <p>In all facets of my life I try to make sure that I am as multi-disciplined as possible. I am a Junior Web Developer, national representative for Great Britain in kendo, Aerialist and a Destroyer of Nutella jars. The saying would indicate that I could only ever achieve greatness in one, or mediocrity in all. However  as David Cole, Designer at  Quora states.</p>

      <em>“Learning is not a zero-sum activity.
        These skills are not mutually exclusive. Picking up Python won't make you forget how to kern.
        ” </em>
        <small>Or in my case.. Eating nutella?</small>


        <h2>The pros of being a jack</h2>

        <p>As of April 2018, I enrolled onto General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive, an intense  12-week course with 4 projects to complete that serve to reflect our development and learning of languages and concepts covered. Since starting I have found that there are more languages, frameworks and technologies out there than you can shake a stick at, and that being versatile and open to change bodes well in a continually-evolving industry.</p>

        <h2>Life after GA</h2>
        <p>I have found a love for creating and problem solving in a way that I didn’t know could really exist before. The want to continue learning, developing, creating is something that I strive for and I want to work in an environment that carries a similar jack-ethos.</p>

        <p>I close on one last note, the phrase I opened with is (rarely) expanded to the full couplet which reads:</p>

        <em>“Jack of all trades, master of none,
          though oftentimes better than master of one.”</em>
